## C and C++ compilers

For running C or C++ code, you just need to have a valid C/C++ compiler installed on your computer. If you are using a Linux operating system, then there is a high chance that it is already installed on your system. But we need to make sure that it is correctly installed.

For checking whether or not you have the compiler (GCC/G++/MinGW) installed on your system or not, you have to check the compiler version first. Simply open your terminal and use gcc --version and g++ --version. If you get the version number, then the compiler is already installed on your system.

You can check the version using the same commands on any operating system, whether that is a Windows, Linux, or macOS-based operating system. If you get feedback on your terminal that it does not know anything about GCC or G++, then you have to install the compiler correctly.

If you are using the most used Windows operating system, then I already have written an in-depth article showing you all the processes step-by-step on freeCodeCamp. Make sure to read the entire article first, as it also contains a complete video to provide you with complete support.
